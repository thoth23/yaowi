### What is OpenSimulator? ###

OpenSimulator is a 3D Application Server. It can be used to create a virtual environment (or world) which can be accessed through a variety of clients, on multiple protocols. OpenSimulator allows you to develop your environment using the technologies you feel work best - we've designed the software to be easily extendable through loadable modules to build completely custom configurations. OpenSimulator is released under a BSD License, making it both open source, and commercially friendly to embed in products.

Out of the box, OpenSimulator can be used to simulate a virtual environment similar to Second Lifeâ„¢ (including client compatibility).  Other environments, protocols and features are supported via add on modules.

Although OpenSimulator is still considered '''alpha software''', many people are [doing exciting things with it](http://technorati.com/search/opensim?authority=a4&language=en).

### Features ###
Even though OpenSimulator is relatively young software it already has many useful features
  * Supports creating multiple 'worlds' in a single application instance.
  * Supports multiple clients and protocols - access the same world at the same time via multiple protocols.
  * Extensive ability to customize your avatar, both with custom clothing, skins, and attached objects.
  * Realtime Physics Simulation, with multiple engine options including ODE, PhysX, Bullet and more.
  * The ability to create content real time in the environment using in world building tools. What you see is what you get.
  * In world application development using a number of different languages, including LSL/OSSL, C#, JScript and VB.NET
