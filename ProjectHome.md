# Yet Another OpenSimulator Web Interface #
## Providing a web interface for OpenSimulator grids/admins. ##

---

Yaowi hopes to provide a fully featured management and user interface for OpenSimulator, inclusing

  * CMS system
  * wiki
  * support system
  * user profiles
  * OpenSim login page generator
  * Template system

The site will be available with language packs to translate most things, including experimental auto-language detection based on browser IP etc.

Within this will be an OpenSimulator api, which will hopefully allow other projects to create their own front ends.

**Important note**
Yaowi is still very much in the planning stage, and is in no way, shape or form available or ready for production. At this time I am looking for other PHP coders to help bring together the many parts of this project. If you are interested in joining the project, please drop me an e-mail at alchamist at googlemail dot com.
